# MachineLearningForWirelessNetworks

Intrusion detection is an important requirement in wireless mesh network and the intrusion detection system (IDS) provides security by monitoring data traffic in real 
time. But the major issue in the implementation of machine learning technique-based IDS in WMN is its dimensionality problem. The requirement of large amount of energy
to deal with the dimensionality affects the efficiency of IDS in WMN. Another major drawback in the implementation of IDS with large number of features is the requirement of large execution time. Hence it requires the removal of a large number of irrelevant features for better accuracy. So, in this work, with the help of feature selection techniques like Mutual Information and Genetic Algorithm, we assist in selecting the most relevant features from an IDS dataset, so as the facilitate IDS with better execution time. We have used various ML algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear 
Regression for prediction purpose, out of which Random Forest came out to be the best algorithm.
